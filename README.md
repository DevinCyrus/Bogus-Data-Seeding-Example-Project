#### What is Bogus

Bogus is a C# library inspired by [Faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/) and provides functionality for generating fake data for testing purposes. It allows developers to easily generate placeholder data such as names, addresses, emails, etc., which can be useful in scenarios where you need to populate a database with sample data or create mock objects for testing.

The library is designed to have a fluent syntax, making it easy to generate data with a clean and concise syntax, similar to FluentValidation.
